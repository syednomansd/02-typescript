/*

- Since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, it includes all the built-in types in JavaScript (eg number, string, boolean, object, etc) as well as additional types (eg any, unknown, never, enum, tuple, etc).
- In TypeScript, we set the type of our variables by annotating them.
- The any type can represent any kind of value. Itâ€™s something we should avoid as much as possible because it defeats the purpose of using TypeScript in the first place. A variable of type any can take any kind of value!
- Tuples are fixed-length arrays where each element has a specific type. We often use them for representing two or three related values.
- Enums represent a list of related constants.

// Cheat Sheet

// Annotation

let sales: number = 123_456_789;
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];

// Tuples

let user: [number, string] = [1, 'Mosh']; 

// Enums

enum Size { Small = 1, Medium, Large }; 

// Functions

function calculateTax(income: number): number { 
  return income * .2;
}

// Objects

let employee: {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  retire: (date: Date) => void 
} = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Mosh',
  retire: (date: Date) => {
    console.log(date);
  },
};
